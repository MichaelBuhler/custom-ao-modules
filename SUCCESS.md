# Success

Congratulations, you built a custom module that will run on AO!

The next step is to publish your module to Arweave. Then you can spin up a new process using that module as a template.

What cool stuff are you building? Please join us on the Marshal AO [Discord server](https://discord.gg/KzSRvefPau) and tell us about your project. My handle is `@michaelbuhler`.

Be sure to share your success with the wider community.
